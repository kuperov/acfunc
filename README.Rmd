acfunc
======

This is a package of distribution functions I have found useful for
Bayesian analysis. Distributions include:

  * double Generalized Pareto
  * Weibull (alternative parameterization)
  * student t (alternative parameterization)
  * truncated normal
  * multivariate normal
  * inverse gamma
  * inverse root gamma

All distributions are fully unit tested.

Note: This pacakge is intended primarily for myself. Use it at your own risk!

Installation
------------

    library(devtools)
    install_github('kuperov/acfunc')

Example
-------

Plot a Weibull distribution

```{r}
  library(acfunc)
  gdp.density <- function(x) dgdp(x, xi = 1, alpha = 2)
  plot(gdp.density, from = -5, to = 5, col = 'blue',
       main = expression("Double Generalized Pareto distribution:" ~
                           xi == 1~alpha == 2))
```
