acfunc
======

This is a package of distribution functions I have found useful for
Bayesian analysis. It isn't really intended for public release: others
are welcome to use this code, but be aware that you do so at your own
risk.

Installation
------------

    library(devtools)
    install_github('kuperov/acfunc')
